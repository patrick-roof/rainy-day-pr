# Description

  This is a weather app that will allow you to search a city to get weather data for the current day, and a 5 day forecast. It will be connected with the open weather API in order to get current weather data

## What I've learned

  This project has been extremely helpful to me for learning about how to use API's, and how to use for-loops and objects.
